% Problem: Connectivity problems exist
The end-to-end connectivity of hosts is the key service of the Internet. However, even after 40 years of intense engineering efforts, this connectivity is temporally broken for various reasons, such as link or hardware failure \citep{Markopoulou:2008}, mis-configurations \citep{Mahajan:2002}, or natural disasters \citep{Dainotti:2012:EBH,Schulman:2011}. 

% (Centrality Claim) Why do we care: Requires Troubleshooting Tools (TST) to minimize costs
This shows that there is a real need for methods to systematically detect and locate Internet outages of remote autonomous systems, subnets, and even single hosts. This is particularly true for Internet service providers (ISP), as for example costumers are generating costs for time intensive debugging and support by complaining at the ISP for unreachable networks or the ISP is contractually liable for unreachable networks. An automated, ongoing detection and tracking of connectivity issues of the Internet may generate transparent outage information for customers and enables the ISP to react adequately on a detected reachability problems if possible, for example by changing routes in case of a failure of a transit provider. 

% (What is missing) Introduce the gap that we plan to close: 
Researches and industrial vendors have proposed various approaches for systematically detect, locate and troubleshoot Internet outages and loss of end-to-end reachability.

% State clearly what is missing
However, most of these approaches rely on control-plane information as BGP routing messages or data-plane information achieved by active probing. Both approaches not perfectly suitable for practical usage.

% bash: control plane approaches & active probing approaches
As shown by \citet{Bush:Optometry}, packets in the Internet do not necessarily follow the control plane due to default routes. Moreover, connectivity issues imposed by packet filtering cannot be tracked by control plane approaches \citep{Dainotti:2011:ACI}. Besides legal issues, active probing requires the cumbersome of target selection and increased the load on Internet infrastructure. Furthermore, there is still no active approach which scales well enough for the entire IPv6 address space. Moreover, both approaches are unable to track which part of the Internet is currently actively used by their internal clients. This is required to determine the amount of affected internal clients and therefore to assess the urgency of the outage event. For example, as long as a connectivity issue occurs within an unused remote network, the operator can handle this event with low priority and fix more urgent problems first.

To fill this gap, Schatzmann et al. proposed the fully passive approach called FACT\cite{SchatzmannPAM2011} relying on flow level information to
identify remote connectivity problems. The basic idea of FACT is to
match the corresponding outgoing and incoming flow to a bidirectional
connection. Then the remaining unidirectional connections or unresponsive
connections are extracted and investigated. The detection of an outage
is consolidated by aggregating these unresponsive connections to host,
network and AS level and rating the severity of the events by affected
users. This consolidation is required to reduce the noise of unresponsive
connections caused by scanning or botnets and implies an
implicit prioritization of events which affect many internal network
users.

Schatzmann\cite{SchatzmanThesis2012} proposed to treat certain types 
of Internet services differently because they do not require constant 
reachability. For example, Skype or BitTorrent applications that
are often executed on client machines such as Desktops, Laptops, or
Smartphones are likely to be reachable only for a limited time during a day.
This characteristic is caused by the fact that these machines are often
disconnected from the network to save power or due to mobility effects.

However, this temporal unreachability is not noticed as a problem by end-users.
Therefore, this issues should be tagged by FACT with a lower priority.
To this end, a new type of service classification system is proposed to efficiently label the service type such as HTTP, Skype, or BitTorrent.

In this thesis, the reporting functionalities of FACT are complemented by
another major key aspect of event prioritization, namely the knowledge
about past stability and popularity characteristics of remote services.

In detail, these services are monitored and analyzed on longer time scales
so that the deduced statistical information enables FACT improve
the prioritization of certain connectivity issues. For example, a
remote web server used only by few users that is often unreachable, e.g. due to testing or resource scarcity, should not have the same weight within
the prioritization algorithm of FACT as a popular content distribution
host that was always reachable in the past.

To sum up, the overall goal of this thesis is to extend FACT with
a service monitoring and classification functionality to employ a
third level of event prioritization besides user aggregation and traffic
preselection. In fact, this functionality should enable FACT to focus
even better on relevant connectivity issues which are related to a stable
and popular service.

%Nevertheless, FACT's outage detection is solely based on traffic to TCP port 80 in the hope that the process listening to port 80 is a stable service, e.g. a web server. Since TCP traffic to port 80 is sometimes used by various application protocols different than HTTP, e.g. Skype, to traverse firewall and NAT devices, this assumption is not true in general. Depending on the kind of service or application, the characteristics of its stability and uptime differ significantly, i.e. if a host is a web server providing important content which should be up most of the time, or in the case of a Skype node, which are sytematically changing over time. However, from a flow perspective the connections to a Skype super-node or to a web server look very similar and are often indistinguishable.

%For this reason, the services behind the traffic which FACT is using for outage detection have to be monitored on a longer time scale and are characterized by its stability, relevance and popularity. Afterwards, from these characterized services a smart selection of stable and representative targets is created and fed into FACT for tracking remote connectivity issues. To this end, the observed traffic used for the outage detection can be generalized such that not only traffic to TCP port 80 is considered anymore. 

%The Internet is interconnecting networks all over the world since more than 40 years by 2012. The end-to-end reachability of hosts has always been a basic service of the Internet. However, this reachability is sometimes disrupted for various reasons, such as link or router collapses\citep{}, natural disasters\citep{}, political revolutions\citep{} and human errors\citep{}. There is a real need for methods to systematically detect and locate Internet outages of remote autonomous systems, subnets, and even single hosts if they are of importance. This is particularly true for Internet service providers (ISP), as for example costumÂ·ers are generating costs for time intensive debugging and support by complaining at the ISP for unreachable networks or the ISP is contractually liable for unreachable networks. An automated, ongoing detection and tracking of connectivity issues of the Internet may generate transparent outage information for customers and enables the ISP to react adequately on a detected reachability problems if possible, for example by changing routes in case of a failure of a transit provider. As outlined in section \ref{sec:related_work} in detail, researches and industrial vendors have proposed various approaches for systematically detect, locate and troubleshoot Internet outages and loss of end-to-end reachability. However, most of these approaches rely on control-plane information as BGP routing messages or data-plane information achieved by active probing. For this reason, FACT was introduced by \citet{Schatzmann:PAM} as a flow-based approach of connectivity tracking. This is a fully passive approach for identifying remote connectivity problems and relies solely on flow-level information of cross-border network traffic. This The detection of a outage is consolidated by aggregating the unresponsive hosts to network and AS level and rating the severity of the events by affected users.
%An obvious caveat of this approach lies in the misinterpretation of service failures to host failures in case no other service is running on the observed host. This problem also exists on higher aggregation level, i.e. if a single host fails the entire network / AS is wrongly detected as down. This is even worse if this service or host is very popular with regard to internal network users. Depending on the kind of service, this may be a real problem, i.e. if this host is a web server providing important content, or may be negligible because the service or application connecting to this service is already handling this service outage as in the case of a Skype super-node. However, from a flow-point of view the connections to a Skype super-node or to a web server looks very similar and are often indistinguishable. For this reason, services have to be views at a longer time scale in order to detect services which can be characterized as stable and thus relevant for outage analysis.

\subsection{Reachability Tracking}

% Connection Tracking (Active & Passive)
Severe disruptions of the Internet's end-to-end connectivity is not a new phenomenon, there have been connectivity outages since it early beginning as research project. Despite that the end-to-end connectivity is a very basic service of the Internet, the Internet community has not a deeply founded understanding of the problems that causes its disruption \citep{Bush:Optometry}. A dominant share of researchers focussed on "pathological behavior related to the address space, e.g. bogon advertisements \citep{Feamster:2005}, prefix hijacking \citep{Zhang:2010}, BGP misconfigurations \citep{Mahajan:2002} or DDoS attacks \citep{Chen:2001}"\citep{Bush:Optometry}.

Basically, reachability can be viewed from two perspectives: data-plane and control-plane measurements. The former mentioned studies are mainly based on control-plane information as publicly available BGP data for deducing knowledge about reachability. \citet{Bush:Optometry} pointed out that tracking data-plane reachability with control-plane information is heavily inaccurate due to the effect of secret peering policies, e.g. default routing which allows packets to reach their destination even when a route failed to propagate through BGP. \citet{Bush:Optometry} stated that even very basic data-plane measurements produce better views on reachability than BGP observations. However, control-plane based measurements are not limited to BGP data, \citet{Markopoulou:2008} classified failures in a IP backbone network with IS-IS information and tried to characterize these failures by layers as router, optical/link and maintenance. To sum up, control-plane measurements of reachability are indirect and thus of limited practical usage for systematical reachability tracking.

% I-Seismograph(J. LÃ®)
In contrast, measurements of the data-plane are direct and can be more accurate regarding end-to-end connectivity. Data-plane measurements can be divided into active probes and passive monitoring. Whereas active probes generates additional traffic towards the observed address space of the Internet, passive monitoring relies fully on the traffic generated by servers and clients of the network.

Active probing is widely used for end-to-end reachability problem detection, ranging from rudimentary debugging tools as ping \citep{PING}, paris traceroute \citep{traceroute} or nmap \citep{Nmap} to highly sophisticated, automated outage detection tools as Hubble \citep{Katz:2008}, PlanetSeer \citep{Zhang:2004}. \citet{Bush:Optometry} pointed out there exist some important limitations as filtered packets by firewall and NAT devices or suboptimal routing which result in intermittent problems as packet rerouting. Furthermore, there is no active probing technique known which is able to record the return path in addition to the forward-path which can be extracted for example with traceroute probes. It is not generally true to deduce that forward-path reachability implies return-path reachability as well, since there may be intermittent problems caused by suboptimal routing \citep{Bush:Optometry}.

% Pingin' in the rain (Schulman/Spring)
\citet{Quan12a} implemented an Internet outage detection engine which is able to actively probe an representative part of the Internet and correlate outage events with control-plane information. This is achieved by an sophisticated target selection approach. However, this approach is avoiding some of the drawbacks of active probing as blockage by firewalls and NAT devices by clearly state that they are able to track the "analyzable" IPv4 address space of the Internet which represents the space which is really scannable by active probes. The future scalability of this approach -- especially with respect to IPv6 -- is questionable. 

%_--- PASSIVE --
Besides the big amount of different approaches using active probing, only few approaches are using passive monitoring for reachability tracking. \citet{Dainotti:2011:ACI} presented an approach for an in-depth analysis of connectivity outages caused by political censorship by combining observations from BGP data and data-plane information as backscatter measurements of the UCSD network telescope and active probing data from Ark. Remarkable is their approach of (passively) monitoring of the unsolicited data plane traffic that shed light on Libya's attempts on deploying packet filters for enforcing the Internet censorship. They concluded that this unsolicited and unwanted traffic captured by network telescopes may "illuminate many different types of macroscopic events, including but not limited to broad-scale packet-filtering-based censorship, which is not observable by BGP data."\citep{Dainotti:2011:ACI}.

\subsection{Service Detection} 

% Service Detection (Active & Passive, completeness vs. scalability / importance)
The discovery and characterization of services in the Internet is most successfully done on a massive scale, ironically not by researchers but by worms and other malware\citep{Chen:2007}. Generally, service detection methods can be divided into two approaches: passive monitoring and active probing. 

As \citet{Bartlett07b} pointed out that active probing is able to detect all visible and scannable services, which is thus invasive and legally constrained. On the other hand, passive monitoring is able to find transient services, but fails to detect idle services. In their work, they compared the "accuracy of passive and active approaches to service discovery and showed that they are comlimentary"\citep{Bartlett07b}. They concluded that for best results multiple active scans are combined with a long lasting passive monitoring. 

\citet{Leonard:2010} developed an Internet-wide service scanner called IRLscanner. They designed their scanner to maximize politeness at remote networks by smartly choose scanning rates.
