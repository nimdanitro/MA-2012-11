\section{Flowbox Modules}

\subsection{Netflow Data Parser}

\subsection{In-Out Filter}
% configured with internal prefixes, responsible for tagging flows with direction. Setting transit and internal network traffic (in-in) as invalid (filtering away)

\subsection{BiFlow Cache}
This module is responsible for generating bidirectional flows from the incoming unidirectional flows. This is done by storing the flows in hash table with a hash key which is identical for incoming and outgoing flows. For correct operation of the biflow cache, a properly configured InOutFilter is required in front of the biflow cache since it requires that all flows must be tagged either as outgoing or as incoming. 

\subsection{Fan-Out Filter}
% scanning detection and elimination
% state algorithm.. analog to tech report

\subsection{Noise Filter}
% remove single packet flows / unidirectional biflows...
