\section{Methodology
\label{section:methodology}}

To achieve this goal of enhancing the reporting functionalities of FACT with
knowledge about the past stability and popularity characteristics, the following
three steps are planned for extending FACT as illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:FACT}.

In a first step, a server socket detector is implemented. The challenge of the
server socket detection lies in the fact that the netflow data does not provide
enough precise timing information to determine which flow is originated from the
client and thus determine the server's socket. Therefore, the server socket
detection is achieved by the assumption that server sockets act as concentrators
in the sense that several clients have connections to the identical server
socket and bases on the work shown in
\cite{Schatzmann:Dissection,Schatzmann:Mining,Schatzmann:Tracing} and is
discussed in more detail in section \ref{section:socket_detection}.

Secondly, the previously detected server sockets are continually monitored and
especially the successful and unsuccessful connection attempts are recorded by
the server socket tracker.
Furthermore, these information are used to update the statistical information of
visibility, popularity and stability. Section \ref{section:socket_tracking}
covers this step in detail.

In a third step, the number of server sockets have to be reduced and selected
such that FACT is able to use these sockets for outage tracking. In particular,
the server sockets coverage of the Internet address space has to be optimized.
It makes no sense to select only the most popular sockets if they are all
located in the same /24 network.

Finally, FACT has to be adopted to optimally use the preselected and rated
server sockets for prioritizing relevant connectivity issues by reducing outage
alerts based on single host outages of unstable services.

\label{section:flowbox}}

\subsection{Preprocessing}

% configured with internal prefixes, responsible for tagging flows with direction. Setting transit and internal network traffic (in-in) as invalid (filtering away)
\subsection{Connection Cache} This module is responsible for generating
bidirectional flows from the incoming unidirectional flows. This is done by
storing the flows in hash table with a hash key which is identical for incoming
and outgoing flows. For correct operation of the biflow cache, a properly
configured InOutFilter is required in front of the biflow cache since it
requires that all flows must be tagged either as outgoing or as incoming.
