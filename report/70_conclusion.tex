\section{Conclusion}
This thesis intended to demonstrate how efficient and comfortable FACT is for tracking connectivity issues. FACT has been made even more powerful by adding some new futures like IPv6 support, standardized data input and a smart reporting engine. The big goal of pushing FACT towards a state in which it could be used is still not reached and some further work is required. The entire framework should be deamonized so that FACT could run in the background, process traffic traces online and alert - when required  - the network operator about new connectivity issues and require further investigation. Moreover, the false positive rate, recall and precision have to be determined which includes a detailed analysis of the severity and its properties. The future work should also include an advice for choosing a reliable level of the severity constrained by the size of the network.
