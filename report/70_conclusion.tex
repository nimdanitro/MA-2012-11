\section{Conclusion}
Adjusting the traffic preselection of FACT from a port-based heuristic to a 
server socket based approach is far more than just a generalization. 

On the one hand, the server sockets approach is less affected by scanning and 
p2p, acting as a kind of history based scanning filter. Thus, reducing the 
negative effect of malware and p2p churn on the network outage detection. 

On the other hand, a smart composition of the server socket set used for the 
detection process may generally increase the observation coverage of FACT 
without significantly increasing the noise ratio. Hence, the practical usability 
of FACT is increase even more.

The drawback of the approach is clearly the additional resources required to 
store the server sockets and the additional effort to detect, monitor and 
characterize the server sockets. Nevertheless, the good results from chapter 
\ref{chapter:results} indicates that server sockets are quite stable over time 
and that there are even good results possible for events in March, May and 
August 2010 with sockets detected in November 2010. 

However, the selection of server sockets can be cumbersome and directly 
influences the detection sensitivity of FACT. Though, even without any 
optimization the server socket approach is clearly outperforming the original port-based heuristic with respect to the \emph{event-to-noise} ratio. 

\section{Future Work}
% characterize ses by time based activity (night / day, working week, weekend etc.)

% smarter socket set selection => density of network by choosing only the popularst sockets of each network

% automatization of process => danger of excluding sockets affected by events
% => consider full last week?  

% general optimization problem solving approach as simulated annealing => limit number of sockets => pareto front of sockets

% consider different selection methods as clustering analysis approaches, e.g. k-means etc => distance function include also network considerations.. etc. 

% near future public release of FlowBox and FACT
