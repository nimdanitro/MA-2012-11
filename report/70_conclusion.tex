\section{Conclusion}



\section{Future Work}
% characterize ses by time based activity (night / day, working week, weekend etc.)

% smarter socket set selection => density of network by choosing only the popularst sockets of each network

% automatization of process => danger of excluding sockets affected by events
% => consider full last week?  

% general optimization problem solving approach as simulated annealing => limit number of sockets => pareto front of sockets

% consider different selection methods as clustering analysis approaches, e.g. k-means etc => distance function include also network considerations.. etc. 

% near future public release of FlowBox and FACT
