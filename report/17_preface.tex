During the creation of this thesis several people supported me. At this place, I would like to thank them.

At first, I am deeply grateful to Dominik Schatzmann and Dr. Bernhard Ager for their support, their great expertise and their patience in explaining me even basics. They always asked the right questions at the right time, thus directing my focus on the important things. During the last half year, they always provided good remarks and excellent advisory -- not only regarding technical aspects. I really enjoyed the discussions and the process of working on this thesis with them. 

Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Dr. Bernhard Plattner for providing the opportunity to write this thesis in his research group. I enjoyed the support of the entire Computer Engineering Group (CSG) in various situations.
