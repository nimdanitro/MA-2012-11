% Motivation: Monitoring remote connectivity issues is really important since network complexity continously grows. FACT - a Flow-based Connectivity Tracking system - is proposed a year ago and is efficient in alerting network operators about connectivity problems which really affects his network users.
%
% Problem to solve: However FACT has some shortcomings: not IPv6 capable, no central reporting engine, no standardized input.
%
% approach: standardized data input with nfdump data => nfdump collect various types of netflows! Moreover, two weeks o
%
% Results: FACT is IPv6 capable, reads standized data and generates reports which classifies the likelyhood of a connectivity issue.
%
% Conclusion:
